# Python Best Practices and Coding Standards

This document outlines comprehensive best practices and coding standards for Python development, aiming to promote clean, efficient, maintainable, and secure code with modern tooling.

## 1. Code Organization and Structure

### 1.1. Directory Structure Best Practices

*   **Flat is better than nested (but not always).**  Start with a simple structure and refactor as needed.
*   **Packages vs. Modules:** Use packages (directories with `__init__.py`) for logical grouping of modules.
*   **src layout:** Consider using a `src` directory to separate application code from project-level files (setup.py, requirements.txt, etc.). This helps avoid import conflicts and clarifies the project's boundaries.
*   **Typical Project Structure:**

    
    project_name/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── package_name/
    │   │   ├── __init__.py
    │   │   ├── module1.py
    │   │   ├── module2.py
    │   ├── main.py  # Entry point
    ├── tests/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── test_module1.py
    │   ├── test_module2.py
    ├── docs/
    │   ├── conf.py
    │   ├── index.rst
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── pyproject.toml
    ├── README.md
    ├── uv.lock
    

### 1.2. File Naming Conventions

*   **Modules:**  Lowercase, with underscores for readability (e.g., `my_module.py`).
*   **Packages:** Lowercase (e.g., `my_package`). Avoid underscores unless necessary.
*   **Tests:** Start with `test_` (e.g., `test_my_module.py`).

### 1.3. Module Organization Best Practices

*   **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module should have a well-defined purpose.
*   **Imports:**
    *   Order: standard library, third-party, local.
    *   Absolute imports are generally preferred (e.g., `from my_package.module1 import function1`).
    *   Use explicit relative imports (`from . import sibling_module`) when dealing with complex package layouts where absolute imports are overly verbose or impractical.
*   **Constants:**  Define module-level constants in uppercase (e.g., `MAX_ITERATIONS = 100`).
*   **Dunder names:** `__all__`, `__version__`, etc. should be after the module docstring but before any imports (except `from __future__`).  Use `__all__` to explicitly define the public API.

### 1.4. Component Architecture Recommendations

*   **Layered Architecture:** Suitable for larger applications, separating concerns into presentation, business logic, and data access layers.
*   **Microservices:**  For very large applications, consider breaking the system into smaller, independent services.
*   **Hexagonal/Clean Architecture:** Emphasizes decoupling business logic from external dependencies like databases and frameworks.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Use dependency injection to improve testability and reduce coupling.

### 1.5. Code Splitting Strategies

*   **By Functionality:**  Split code into modules based on distinct functionalities (e.g., user management, data processing).
*   **By Layer:** Separate presentation, business logic, and data access code.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Use `importlib.import_module()` to load modules on demand, improving startup time.
*   **Conditional Imports:** Import modules only when needed, based on certain conditions.

## 2. Function and Code Quality Standards

### 2.1. Function Naming and Documentation

*   **Explicit Function Names:** Always use descriptive, explicit function names that clearly communicate the function's purpose and behavior. Never rely on comments to explain what a function does.
*   **Self-Documenting Code:** Write code that reads like well-written prose. The function name should be so clear that additional comments become unnecessary.
*   **Avoid Comments for Function Logic:** Instead of adding comments to explain function logic, refactor the code into smaller, well-named functions that express the intent clearly.
*   **Examples:**
    ```python
    # BAD: Requires comments to understand
    def process_data(data):
        # Check if data is valid
        if not data:
            return None
        # Transform data format
        transformed = []
        for item in data:
            # Apply business rules
            if item.status == 'active':
                transformed.append(item.value * 1.2)
        return transformed
    
    # GOOD: Self-documenting with explicit names
    def calculate_active_item_values_with_markup(data):
        if self._is_empty_dataset(data):
            return None
        return self._apply_markup_to_active_items(data)
    
    def _is_empty_dataset(self, data):
        return not data
    
    def _apply_markup_to_active_items(self, data):
        return [
            self._calculate_item_value_with_markup(item) 
            for item in data 
            if self._is_active_item(item)
        ]
    
    def _is_active_item(self, item):
        return item.status == 'active'
    
    def _calculate_item_value_with_markup(self, item):
        return item.value * 1.2
    ```

### 2.2. Function Design Principles

*   **Pure Functions:** Prefer pure functions that don't have side effects and always return the same output for the same input.
*   **Single Responsibility:** Each function should do one thing and do it well.
*   **Function Length:** Keep functions short and focused. If a function is getting long, break it into smaller functions.
*   **Parameter Clarity:** Use explicit parameter names and avoid boolean traps.

## 3. Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

### 3.1. Design Patterns

*   **Singleton:**  Restrict instantiation of a class to one object.
*   **Factory:**  Create objects without specifying the exact class to be created.
*   **Observer:**  Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
*   **Strategy:**  Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
*   **Decorator:**  Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.
*   **Context Manager:** Guarantees resources are properly cleaned up (e.g., files are closed).

### 3.2. Recommended Approaches for Common Tasks

*   **Data Validation:** Use libraries like `pydantic` or `marshmallow` for data validation and serialization.
*   **Configuration Management:** Use libraries like `python-decouple`, `dynaconf` or standard library's `configparser` to manage environment-specific settings.
*   **Logging:** Use the `logging` module for structured logging. Configure log levels and handlers appropriately.
*   **Command-Line Interfaces:** Use `argparse`, `click` or `typer` for creating command-line interfaces.
*   **Asynchronous Programming:** Use `asyncio` for I/O-bound and concurrency problems.

### 3.3. Anti-patterns and Code Smells

*   **God Class:** A class that does too much.  Break it down into smaller, more focused classes.
*   **Shotgun Surgery:**  Making small changes to many different classes at once. Indicates poor cohesion.
*   **Spaghetti Code:**  Unstructured and difficult-to-follow code.  Refactor using well-defined functions and classes.
*   **Duplicate Code:**  Extract common code into reusable functions or classes (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself).
*   **Magic Numbers/Strings:**  Use named constants instead of hardcoded values.
*   **Nested Callbacks:**  Avoid excessive nesting of callbacks. Use `async/await` or promises for better readability.
*   **Premature Optimization:** Don't optimize code before identifying bottlenecks.
*   **Excessive Comments:** Over-commenting code instead of writing self-documenting code with clear function names.

### 3.4. State Management Best Practices

*   **Stateless Functions:** Prefer stateless functions where possible.
*   **Immutable Data:** Use immutable data structures to prevent accidental modification.
*   **Explicit State:**  Manage state explicitly using classes or data structures.  Avoid relying on global variables.
*   **Context Variables:** Use `contextvars` (Python 3.7+) for managing request-scoped state in asynchronous applications.
*   **Redux-like patterns:** Consider redux-like patterns for managing client-side and complex application state.

### 3.5. Error Handling Patterns

*   **Specific Exceptions:** Catch specific exceptions rather than broad `Exception` or `BaseException`.
*   **`try...except...finally`:** Use `finally` to ensure cleanup code is always executed.
*   **Context Managers:**  Use context managers (`with open(...) as f:`) for resource management.
*   **Logging Errors:** Log exceptions with complete traceback information.
*   **Raising Exceptions:** Raise exceptions with informative error messages.
*   **Custom Exceptions:** Create custom exception classes for specific error conditions.
*   **Avoid using exceptions for control flow.** Exceptions should represent exceptional circumstances.

## 4. Performance Considerations

### 4.1. Optimization Techniques

*   **Profiling:**  Use `cProfile` to identify performance bottlenecks.
*   **Efficient Data Structures:**  Choose the right data structure for the task (e.g., `set` for membership testing, `dict` for lookups).
*   **List Comprehensions and Generators:**  Use list comprehensions and generator expressions for concise and efficient code.
*   **Vectorization with NumPy:**  Use NumPy for numerical computations, leveraging vectorized operations.
*   **Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT):**  Consider using JIT compilers like Numba for performance-critical code.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms using `functools.lru_cache` or external caching libraries like Redis or Memcached.
*   **String Concatenation:** Use `''.join(iterable)` for efficient string concatenation.
*   **Avoid Global Variables:** Accessing local variables is faster than accessing global variables.
*   **Cython:** Use Cython to write C extensions for Python, improving performance.

### 4.2. Memory Management Considerations

*   **Garbage Collection:**  Understand Python's garbage collection mechanism.
*   **Object References:**  Be mindful of object references and circular dependencies, which can prevent garbage collection.
*   **Memory Profiling:** Use `memory_profiler` to identify memory leaks.
*   **Slots:** Use `__slots__` in classes to reduce memory footprint (disables `__dict__`).
*   **Generators:** Use generators for processing large datasets without loading them into memory.
*   **Data type sizing:** Use the most efficient data types possible to reduce memory use.

### 4.3. Rendering Optimization

*   N/A for core Python libraries. Relevant for GUI frameworks (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy).
*   For web development with frameworks such as Django, Flask, or Pyramid, use efficient templating, caching and database query optimizations.

### 4.4. Bundle Size Optimization

*   N/A for core Python libraries. Relevant for web applications or when creating executable bundles.
*   Use tools like `PyInstaller` or `cx_Freeze` to create executable bundles.
*   Minimize dependencies to reduce bundle size.
*   Use code minification techniques.

### 4.5. Lazy Loading Strategies

*   **Module Loading:**  Use `importlib.import_module()` to load modules on demand.
*   **Data Loading:** Load large datasets only when needed.
*   **Deferred Execution:**  Use generators or coroutines to defer execution of code.

## 5. Security Best Practices

### 5.1. Common Vulnerabilities and Prevention

*   **SQL Injection:**  Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection attacks.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Sanitize user input and escape output to prevent XSS attacks.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  Use CSRF tokens to protect against CSRF attacks.
*   **Command Injection:**  Avoid executing arbitrary commands based on user input. If necessary, sanitize input carefully.
*   **Path Traversal:**  Validate file paths to prevent path traversal attacks.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Implement rate limiting and input validation to protect against DoS attacks.
*   **Pickle Deserialization:**  Avoid using `pickle` to deserialize untrusted data, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution. Use safer alternatives like JSON or Protocol Buffers.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Regularly audit and update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
*   **Hardcoded Secrets:** Never hardcode secrets (passwords, API keys) in code. Use environment variables or secure configuration files.

### 5.2. Input Validation Best Practices

*   **Whitelisting:**  Validate input against a whitelist of allowed values.
*   **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to validate input formats.
*   **Data Type Validation:**  Ensure input data types are correct.
*   **Length Validation:**  Limit the length of input strings.
*   **Sanitization:**  Remove or escape potentially harmful characters from input.
*   **Use libraries:** Use libraries like `cerberus` and `schematics` to assist with validating the input.

### 5.3. Authentication and Authorization Patterns

*   **Authentication:**
    *   Use strong password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Use secure session management techniques.
    *   Consider using a dedicated authentication service (e.g., Auth0, Okta).
*   **Authorization:**
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
    *   Use a permissions system to control access to resources.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege.
    *   Use access tokens (JWTs).

### 5.4. Data Protection Strategies

*   **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
*   **Data Masking:** Mask sensitive data when displaying it to users.
*   **Tokenization:** Replace sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens.
*   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Implement DLP measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization.
*   **Regular backups and disaster recovery plans.**

### 5.5. Secure API Communication

*   **HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS for API communication.
*   **API Keys:**  Use API keys for authentication.
*   **OAuth 2.0:**  Use OAuth 2.0 for delegated authorization.
*   **Input validation**: Validate all API requests before processing.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** Implement WAF to provide centralized security layer.

## 6. Testing Approaches

### 6.1. Unit Testing Strategies

*   **Test Individual Units:** Test individual functions, classes, or modules in isolation.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write tests before writing code.
*   **Coverage:**  Aim for high test coverage.
*   **Assertion Styles:** Use appropriate assertion methods (e.g., `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, `assertRaises`).
*   **Boundary conditions:** Test boundary conditions and edge cases.
*   **Error conditions:** Test that exceptions are raised when appropriate.

### 6.2. Integration Testing Approaches

*   **Test Interactions:** Test the interactions between different modules or components.
*   **Database Testing:** Test database interactions.
*   **API Testing:** Test API endpoints.
*   **Mock External Services:** Use mocks to simulate external services during integration tests.
*   **Focus on key workflows.** Integration tests should exercise the most important user workflows.

### 6.3. End-to-End Testing Recommendations

*   **Test Entire System:** Test the entire system from end to end.
*   **User Perspective:** Write tests from the perspective of the user.
*   **Browser Automation:** Use browser automation tools like Selenium or Playwright.
*   **Real-World Scenarios:** Simulate real-world scenarios in end-to-end tests.
*   **Focus on critical paths.** End-to-end tests are expensive to write and maintain, so focus on the most critical paths.

### 6.4. Test Organization Best Practices

*   **Separate Test Directory:**  Keep tests in a separate `tests` directory.
*   **Mirror Source Structure:**  Mirror the source code structure in the test directory.
*   **Test Modules:** Create test modules for each source module.
*   **Test Classes:**  Use test classes to group related tests.
*   **Use a test runner:** Use `pytest` or `unittest` test runners.
*   **Use fixtures:** Utilize fixtures to setup and tear down resources for tests.

### 6.5. Mocking and Stubbing Techniques

*   **`unittest.mock`:** Use the `unittest.mock` module for mocking and stubbing.
*   **Patching:**  Use `patch` to replace objects with mocks during tests.
*   **Side Effects:**  Define side effects for mocks to simulate different scenarios.
*   **Mocking External Dependencies:** Mock external dependencies like databases, APIs, and file systems.
*   **Use dependency injection for testability.** Dependency injection makes it easier to mock dependencies.

## 7. Common Pitfalls and Gotchas

### 7.1. Frequent Mistakes

*   **Mutable Default Arguments:**  Avoid using mutable default arguments in function definitions.
*   **Scope of Variables:**  Be aware of variable scope in nested functions.
*   **`==` vs. `is`:**  Use `==` for value comparison and `is` for object identity comparison.
*   **`try...except` Blocks:** Placing too much code inside try blocks. Keep try blocks as small as possible.
*   **Ignoring Exceptions:** Swallowing exceptions without handling or logging them.
*   **Incorrect indentation.**  Indentation errors are a common source of bugs.
*   **Not using virtual environments.** Not using virtual environments can lead to dependency conflicts.

### 7.2. Edge Cases

*   **Floating-Point Arithmetic:** Be aware of the limitations of floating-point arithmetic.
*   **Unicode Handling:** Handle Unicode strings carefully.
*   **File Encoding:**  Specify file encoding when reading and writing files.
*   **Time Zones:**  Handle time zones correctly.
*   **Resource limits:** Be aware of and handle system resource limits (e.g., file handles, memory).

### 7.3. Version-Specific Issues

*   **Python 2 vs. Python 3:** Be aware of the differences between Python 2 and Python 3.
*   **Syntax Changes:**  Be aware of syntax changes in different Python versions.
*   **Library Compatibility:**  Ensure that libraries are compatible with the Python version being used.
*   **Deprecated features.** Avoid using deprecated features.

### 7.4. Compatibility Concerns

*   **Operating Systems:** Test code on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
*   **Python Implementations:**  Consider compatibility with different Python implementations (CPython, PyPy, Jython).
*   **Database Versions:** Ensure compatibility with different database versions.
*   **External Libraries:**  Be aware of compatibility issues with external libraries.

### 7.5. Debugging Strategies

*   **`pdb`:**  Use the `pdb` debugger for interactive debugging.
*   **Logging:**  Use logging to track program execution.
*   **Print Statements:** Use print statements for simple debugging.
*   **Assertions:**  Use assertions to check for expected conditions.
*   **Profiling:** Use profilers to identify performance bottlenecks.
*   **Code Analysis Tools:** Use code analysis tools like pylint or flake8 to detect potential problems.
*   **Remote debugging:** Use remote debugging tools when debugging code running on remote servers.

## 8. Modern Tooling and Environment

### 8.1. Required Development Tools

*   **Package Manager:** `uv` (MANDATORY - Only uv should be used for package management)
*   **IDEs:** PyCharm, VS Code (with Python extension), Sublime Text.
*   **Virtual Environment Managers:** `uv` (integrated virtual environment management)
*   **Debuggers:** `pdb`, IDE debuggers.
*   **Profilers:** `cProfile`, `memory_profiler`.
*   **Linters:** `ruff` (modern, fast linter), `pylint`, `flake8`.
*   **Formatters:** `ruff format` (recommended), `black`, `autopep8`.
*   **Static Analyzers:** `mypy`, `pyright`.
*   **Notebook environments**: Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, Google Colab.

### 8.2. UV Package Manager Standards

*   **Mandatory Usage:** `uv` MUST be used as the sole package manager for all Python projects.
*   **Project Initialization:** Use `uv init` to initialize new projects.
*   **Dependency Installation:** Always use `uv add <package>` instead of hardcoding dependencies.
*   **Development Dependencies:** Use `uv add --dev <package>` for development-only dependencies.
*   **Dependency Removal:** Use `uv remove <package>` to remove packages.
*   **Environment Management:** Use `uv venv` for virtual environment creation.
*   **Lock File:** Always commit `uv.lock` to ensure reproducible builds.
*   **Examples:**
    ```bash
    # Initialize project
    uv init my-project
    
    # Add runtime dependencies
    uv add requests fastapi pydantic
    
    # Add development dependencies
    uv add --dev pytest mypy ruff
    
    # Remove dependency
    uv remove old-package
    
    # Install all dependencies
    uv sync
    
    # Run scripts
    uv run python main.py
    uv run pytest
    ```

### 8.3. Build Configuration Best Practices

*   **`pyproject.toml`:**  Use `pyproject.toml` for all project configuration (PEP 518, PEP 621).
*   **UV Configuration:** Configure uv-specific settings in `pyproject.toml`:
    ```toml
    [project]
    name = "my-project"
    version = "0.1.0"
    description = "My awesome project"
    dependencies = [
        # Dependencies managed by uv add
    ]
    
    [build-system]
    requires = ["hatchling"]
    build-backend = "hatchling.build"
    
    [tool.uv]
    dev-dependencies = [
        # Dev dependencies managed by uv add --dev
    ]
    ```
*   **Virtual Environments:**  Use `uv venv` to create isolated environments.
*   **Reproducible builds:** Ensure reproducible builds using `uv.lock`.

### 8.4. Linting and Formatting Recommendations

*   **PEP 8:** Adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines.
*   **Ruff:** Use `ruff` as the primary linter and formatter (fast and comprehensive).
*   **Configuration Example:**
    ```toml
    [tool.ruff]
    line-length = 88
    target-version = "py311"
    
    [tool.ruff.lint]
    select = ["E", "F", "I", "N", "UP", "RUF"]
    ignore = ["E501"]  # Line too long
    
    [tool.ruff.format]
    quote-style = "double"
    indent-style = "space"
    ```
*   **Pre-commit Hooks:** Use pre-commit hooks to run linters and formatters:
    ```bash
    uv add --dev pre-commit
    ```
*   **Consistent Style:** Maintain a consistent code style throughout the project.

### 8.5. Deployment Best Practices

*   **UV in Production:** Use `uv` for production dependency management.
*   **Container Images:** Use `uv` in Docker images for faster builds:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM python:3.11-slim
    
    # Install uv
    COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /usr/local/bin/uv
    
    # Copy project files
    COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./
    
    # Install dependencies
    RUN uv sync --frozen --no-dev
    
    # Copy application code
    COPY . .
    
    # Run application
    CMD ["uv", "run", "python", "main.py"]
    ```
*   **Process Managers:** Use process managers like `systemd`, `Supervisor`, or `Docker` to manage application processes.
*   **Web Servers:**  Use web servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI to serve web applications.
*   **Load Balancing:** Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
*   **Containerization:** Use containerization technologies like Docker to package and deploy applications.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** Manage infrastructure using IaC tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.

### 8.6. CI/CD Integration Strategies

*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically build and test code on every commit.
*   **UV in CI/CD:** Use `uv` in CI/CD pipelines for faster dependency installation:
    ```yaml
    # GitHub Actions example
    name: CI
    on: [push, pull_request]
    
    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4
          - name: Install uv
            uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v3
          - name: Set up Python
            run: uv python install
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: uv sync
          - name: Run tests
            run: uv run pytest
          - name: Run linting
            run: uv run ruff check
    ```
*   **Automated Testing:**  Include automated tests in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Code Analysis:** Integrate code analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Automated deployments.** Automate the deployment process to reduce manual effort and errors.

By adhering to these modern best practices and coding standards, developers can create Python code that is more robust, maintainable, secure, and follows current industry standards with cutting-edge tooling.
